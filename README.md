This repo contains codes of HRU (hydrologic response unit) discretization.
Specifically, the discretization process is detailed in the folder discretize. 
All the operations (*.ipynb) are controlled by a control file named 'control_active.txt' which contains all the required inputs and configurations of HRU discretization. 
As such, users do not need to edit *.ipynb files, but only the control file, to adjust their discretization.

More details will come after this code being tested by more users.
